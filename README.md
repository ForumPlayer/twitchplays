Twitchplays
===========
This is proof of concept code that anyone can use to make their own "Twitch Plays Pokemon" style gaming experience.

Basic idea:
 - Connect to twitch IRC server and join user's twitch channel
 - Receive commands from users in channel
 - Translate commands into button presses and send button presses to window of game
 
 In order to switch games, you will need to change your IRC commands and key mappings.
